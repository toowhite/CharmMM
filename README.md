# CharmMM

CharmMM is a tool to perfectly set Windows wallpaper on multi-monitors. 

## Motivation
In multi-monitor settings, Windows built-in wallpaper does not work well if you have displays like that:

Either the wallpaper get cropped, or there is a lot of blank area on screen...

This tool can help you get perfect wallpaper set.
